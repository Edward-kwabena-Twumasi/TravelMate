Undergraduate Research Project: Integrated ticketing for booking buses, trains, and flights with ease and a lot of innovative features. 

## Background

We identified that the various transportation companies in Ghana,
especially bus transportation systems lacked platforms for ticketing and reservation as well as
getting customers informed about availability. This majorly contributed to customer dissatisfaction 

## The solution
Develop an integrated ticketing system for buses, trains, and flights. 
1. Add features for transport companies to enroll
2. Allow companies to set up and schedule traveling timelines 
3. Add features for price comparison and availability checking
4. Add location-aware features for tracking and more
